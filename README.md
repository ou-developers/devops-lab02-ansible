# Deploy a web app to multiple compute instances

USED IN LAB 02-1

Ansible playbooks automate configuration, deployment, and orchestration tasks. Ansible playbooks use a declarative language (YAML) that allows you to describe infrastructure configuration, deployment policy, and the orchestration of complex process steps. OCI provides a set of Example Playbooks for you to use.
In this lab, you will learn how to install and configure an Apache webserver using an Ansible Playbook. Additionally, you will learn how to spin up the Apache applications and deploy that to two compute instances.
